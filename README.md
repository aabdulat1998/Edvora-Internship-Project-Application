# Edvora-Internship-Project-Application

## Purpose
This is a sample project that is used for submission to the Edvora IOS mobile Application Intern position.

## Application UI
The main elements of the UI are the filter, the horizontal scrollable product cards, and the vertical scrollable unique products. (Figure 1) <br />
Each product is loaded in from a random JSON file, which is parsed into product, state, and city array to implement the Filter function properly. (Figure 2) <br />
A custom bottom popup card view was used to display the filters available to the user. (Figure 3) <br />
